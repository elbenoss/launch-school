#Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.
names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)
# the names are contained in a set and are not ordered, it is possible but improbably for these names to print in alphabetical order
