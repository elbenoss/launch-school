#What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

if True:
    my_value = 20

print(my_value)

# if condition is true then my_value is assigned 20, thus printing 20
# the truthy of an if true conditional is true because no other condition exists to make it false

if False:
    my_new_value = 42

print(my_new_value)

# if false does not have a truthy condition so my_new_value is never assigned
