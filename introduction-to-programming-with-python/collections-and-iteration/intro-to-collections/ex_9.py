my_list = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]
another_list = list(my_list)
#Given the above code, answer the following questions and explain your answers:

#Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal?
# the lists are equal because they have equivalent values
#Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object?
# the lists are not the same object because the list constructor creates a new object
#Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal?
# the nested lists are equal because they have the same values
#Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same object?
# the nested lists are the same object because nested lists aren't copied. instead they point to the same object in the heap
